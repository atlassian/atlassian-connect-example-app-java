## Running your application
- You can run this app in 2 simple steps:
  - **Install dependencies** - Run `mvn clean install`.
  - **Tunneling** - For this purpose, we are using ngrok. You need to set the ngrok authtoken in the env file, so please make sure you have a ngrok account. Simply go to ngrok and copy your authtoken and paste it in the .env file.
